# :dollar::moneybag: ATM :dollar:

In this one, you are a thief :shipit:

It's 3 a.m. and you go to an ATM in order to make some money. But come on, you're not gonna pick up a crowbar and smash the poor machine because of a few bucks, just figure out a way to make it spontaneously give it to you.

## :checkered_flag: Objective - Make the ATM spit all the cash out of it
