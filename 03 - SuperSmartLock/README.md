# :lock: SuperSmartLock

Welcome to the third lab, Agent {{username}}! :detective:

Obviously, I don't need to tell you what you have to do, because you already know, but I like to be longwinded.

You are a spy, and you are infiltrating another country's secret base. Here's the problem: you are in front of a door which supposedly leads you to the secret thing we are looking for (I'm calling it "secret thing" because maybe there's people reading it on GitHub, we can never have too much safety), but this flipping door has a self-called "Super Smart Lock", I don't know what that means, but it must be something pretty secure. Is there any way to unlock it? :eyes:
