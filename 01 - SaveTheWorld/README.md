# :earth_americas: Save The World

At this first lab, you work in the biggest nuclear power plant of the whole planet, which is responsible for powering the majority of the countries.

During one of your duties, an uknown failure happens and this accident must be stopped. There is an executable tool who shuts down all of the power plant's systems, but it requires a password, and no one knows what it might be, because in fact, no one ever needed to do this general shut down process.

If this accident is not stopped, it will represent a colossal threat to the entire human life.
